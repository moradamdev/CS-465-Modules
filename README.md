Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
-For the front end we used JavaScript and Express HTML. The actual display of the front end, as in the text, images, and links that you see on the screen were all done through HTML code while the functionality, like what happens when you click a button, was done through JavaScript using Angular as our front end framework to streamline everything. In order to store the travel data, like the types of vacations added by the admin user, we used a MongoDB database because we needed to store data somewhere on a server that could be communicated with on any computer instead of storing it locally on the users computer since that would only allow them to see updates.

Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
-JSON is just text that is formatted in a way for us to easily be able to read data in an object. We're able to read JSON which we can obtain from the backend and use the data from it to display information on the front end

Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
-In a fullstack application, methods are blocks of code that organize your code and can be used to call specific functions from later on anywhere else in your code. Endpoints are just where the API should send the data to, and sercurity is just certain checks that are in place to make sure the right user is gaining access to the right information requested.

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
-This course has helped me become even more familiar with Angular which I appreciate. I have used it before, but not in a long time, so it is really good to refresh my Angular skills because knowing multiple front end frameworks is always beneficial in the real world where one company might use React, but another company might use Angular. Better to have knowledge in multiple different frameworks so you are more marketable.
